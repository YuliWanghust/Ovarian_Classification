Our study aims to develop a comprehensive end-to-end pipeline. We first evaluate SAM's performance in segmenting ovarian lesions on MRI. Building on this, we then develop a robust DL model for distinguishing between benign and malignant ovarian lesions using MRI data. By leveraging SAM-segmented images, we seek to enhance the effectiveness and generalizability of our diagnostic approach, ultimately improving clinical outcomes for patients. The workflow depicting the integration of T1CE and T2WI with ROI segmentation, pre-processed along with clinical data, into the deep learning model for lesion classification.
